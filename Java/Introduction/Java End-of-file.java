/*
The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

Output Format

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.*/

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int l = 1;
        while(sc.hasNext())
        {
            System.out.println(l +" "+ sc.nextLine());
            l++;
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
